##Event Espresso - Advanced Email Notifications v0.1.2
Configure cron-fired emails leading up to and/or after an event!

####Introduction

This plugin simply adds a metabox to the Event Espresso's edit/add event pages. The meta box, seen below, sports a simple interface which allows the user to activate drip emails that will automatically send a given number of days prior to or after the event. Emails sent with this plugin support the same shortcodes as the built-in Event Espresso emailer.

By hooking into Wordpress's cron scheduler, all email dispacthes are performed automatically on a daily basis. 

####Todo:
1. Allow number of emails to be varied for each event
2. Eliminate the reliance on an additional table
3. Prettify UI
